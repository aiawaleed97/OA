        <h2>What is Bohemian Design? 
            
        </h2>
        <p2>
            Bohemian style interior design began in the 19th century in Paris, France. It was inspired by artists, writers, performers, and nomads who believed creativity was more valuable than money â€” the original bohemians. With the convergence of their respective cultures, ideals, and refusal to conform to what was accepted, they inadvertently started an interior design trend. The bohemian style, named for those nomadic artists, intended to overturn beauty standards by tossing out the rules and embracing the unconventional.

        <h3>What is industrial style ? </h3>
        <p3>
            Industrial style or industrial chic refers to an aesthetic trend in interior design that takes clues from old factories and industrial spaces that in recent years have been converted to lofts and other living spaces. Industrial style can also be seen in the use of unexpected materials used in building. Shipping containers are now being used in architecture for homes and commercial spaces. The Industrial style of design is most commonly found in urban areas including cities and lofts. These are prime locations because they provide almost a blank space for homeowners to get started with a fresh canvas

        <p5>
            The term new classic entails combining modern elements that are the perfect blend between elegance and artistry. The interior design specialists suggest that when it comes to this type of decor, the owners should opt for really avant-garde materials as well as colors. Classic style includes well-made furniture with detailing such as inlay and carved or turned legs, as well as pieces with ornate detailing, sometimes with a floral or fauna influence. Fabrics that have texture and subtle patterns, and stripes mixed with block colours, are popular choices.
